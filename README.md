https://github.com/hosua/sdl2-grid/assets/22788738/6a682d61-5d16-410e-a766-e598570c0d8b

A fun little project that demonstrates different path-finding algorithms with pretty visuals.

Made using SDL2 and C++.

# Compilation Instructions
```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```
then run with `./grid-game`.

If you want, you can also just run the `./run.sh` script to compile and run everything.

As of writing, only BFS and DFS are implemented.
